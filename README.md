Team name - Noobcoders

This project is a part of the hackathon HackNight.We have developed 2 applications 1.RoboVision  2.Prescriber

RoboVision:

An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia,
the heart can beat too fast, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm. When a heart beats too fast, 
the condition is called tachycardia. When a heart beats too slowly, the condition is called bradycardia.

This webapp is used to detect whether a person is suffering from arrhythmia by processing 
the ecg reports of the persons.This app basically uses machine learning models.
The dataset are already trained and based on the ecg input,the person will get
notified on the type of heart beat [N,S,V,F,Q]
Normal,SupraVentricular Ectopic ,Ventricular Ectopic,Fusion,Unknown Beat
For the demo please check out the recorded video which is present in the outputs folder 


Prescriber:

This is a Python GUI application developed using Tkinter for GUI window,
opencv for image manipulation, pillow for image conversion from jpg to pdf format 
and SMTPlib for the mail transfer of the prescription. 
This is mainly done due to the COVID and social distancing times where a doctor 
can have it running on his windows system and just type out the details like 
name, age, symptoms etc and send the prescription by saving on the computer 
and sending it through mail. The uses of this system is the paperless feature 
of the script and avoids the loss of prescriptions which would cause a great 
harm to the patient. 
For the demo please check out the recorded video which is present in the outputs folder
